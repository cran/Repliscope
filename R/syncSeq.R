#' Replication profiles budding yeast arrest-release samples
#'
#' Replication profiles of wild type S. cerevisiae arrest-release samples
#' (AUY077 strain). The cells were arrested in G1 with alpha-factor
#' followed by release using pronase. The samples were collected
#' before the release (aFactor) and various time intervals after
#' the release (25min,30min,35min,40min,45min,50min and 90min)
#' Extracted DNA was sequenced and mapped to sacCer3 genome. Unique
#' reads for replicating (post-release) and non-replicating (aFactor)
#' samples were calculated in 1 kb genomic bins. The ratios were
#' created by dividing 'score' values from replicating samples by
#' non-replicating sample 'score' values, adjusted by total number
#' of reads. The ratio values were further adjusted based on bulk
#' genome replication (as determined by flow cytometry), to put the
#' values onto biologically relevant relative copy number scale from
#' 1 to 2. The relative copy number values were smoothed using cubic
#' spline.
