\description{
Sequence read coverage ratios for wild type sample
(T7107 strain). The cells were stained with DNA dye and sorted
based on DNA content into S or G2/M phase fractions. Extracted
DNA was sequenced and mapped to sacCer3 genome. Unique reads
for replicating (S) and non-replicating (G2/M) samples were
 calculated in 1 kb genomic bins. The ratio was created by
dividing 'score' values from replicating sample by non-
replicating sample 'score' values, adjusted by total number
of reads.
